# 🎯 What-a-Div: The Ultimate Click-Fest!

> **Warning:** This game may cause sudden bursts of competitive spirit, finger cramps, and an uncontrollable urge to prove you have ninja-like reflexes! 🥷

## 🤔 What's This All About?

Remember Whack-a-Mole at the arcade? Well, we've brought that nostalgic chaos to your browser! **What-a-Div** is a delightfully addictive browser game where you hunt down rebellious red squares before they vanish into the digital void. Think of it as:

- 🎪 Whack-a-Mole meets Web Development
- 🏃‍♂️ A race against time and your own reflexes
- 🧠 Proof that simple concepts can be ridiculously fun

Built with nothing but pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no dependencies, just good old-fashioned browser magic! ✨

## 🎮 How to Become a Click Master

1. **Pick Your Battlefield** 🗺️
   - Go small with a cozy 3×3 grid (perfect for warming up)
   - Level up to 4×4 (now we're talking!)
   - Go full beast mode with 5×5 (may the odds be ever in your favor)

2. **Choose Your Time Trial** ⏱️
   - 15 seconds — for the "I'm on a coffee break" crowd
   - 30 seconds — the sweet spot for competitive bragging
   - 60 seconds — for those who want to watch the world burn 🔥

3. **Click "Start" and Let the Mayhem Begin!** 🚀
   - A random cell will flash RED — that's your target!
   - Click it FAST before it disappears like your productivity on a Monday morning
   - Each successful click = 1 point toward eternal glory
   - Miss it? No worries, another one's already spawning!

4. **Time's Up!** 🎊
   - Check your score and decide if you're satisfied... (spoiler: you won't be)
   - Click "Start" again because you KNOW you can do better
   - Repeat until you've achieved enlightenment... or carpal tunnel
